# ðŸ“˜ AI Tutor - Learn From Your Own Books

AI Tutor is a Streamlit web application that allows students and educators to upload their own textbooks or notes (PDFs), ask questions, and receive AI-generated answers and summaries grounded in their materials. The app uses LangChain for document processing, retrieval, and LLM-powered generation.

- **Summarization:** Select any uploaded file and get a concise summary of its content.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interact via a simple Streamlit web app.
